# Deep Reinforcement Learning Code
Currently there are only the codes for distributional reinforcement learning here.
Codes for algorithms: C51, QR-DQN, IQN, QUOTA.

Thanks to [sungyubkim](<https://github.com/sungyubkim>) and [Shangtong Zhang](<https://github.com/ShangtongZhang>)!  

A lot of my codes references their implementations.
