# Deep Reinforcement Learning Code
Currently threr are only the codes for distributional reinforcement learning here.
Thanks to [sungyubkim](<https://github.com/sungyubkim>) and [Shangtong Zhang](<https://github.com/ShangtongZhang>)
A lot of my code references their implementations.

## Dendency

* pytorch
* gym
* numpy
* matplotlib
